# Shifter
Shifter is an add-on for Blender 3D that allows groups of vertices to be
shifted easily. Vertices are placed into groups for the X, Y, and Z axis,
and then those groups can be shifted along the corresponding axis. This
is beneficial over scaling in cases like cabinet doors, where the edges
just need to be moved, not scaled.

### To use:

1. Select object and enter editmode

2. Tools (<kbd>T</kbd>) > Shifter

3. Assign vertices to X, Y, and Z groups

4. Shift vertices using sliders

### Or:

1. Select object

2. Tools (<kbd>T</kbd>) > Shifter > Convert (only works in certain cases, slight
adjustments might have to be done manually)

3. Shift vertices using sliders
